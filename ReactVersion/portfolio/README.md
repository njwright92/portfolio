Welcome to my React-based portfolio site, showcasing my development skills and incorporating popular dependencies such as Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Formik, and Redux Toolkit. This site is a simple yet powerful project developed in alignment with Nucamp's teachings.

In addition to providing information about me and my interests, this site also features links to other sites I've developed and includes a form for requesting custom site development. To ensure a seamless user experience, I've incorporated popular libraries like Redux Toolkit, Formik, Reactstrap, and Bootstrap.

As an added feature, I've included a JavaScript guessing game on my portfolio site, which rewards users with a GIF for correctly guessing the number. To implement this game, I utilized the React Spring library and vanilla JavaScript.

In addition to the aforementioned dependencies, I also utilized other powerful dependencies such as @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, bootstrap-social, font-awesome, gh-pages, mdb-react-ui-kit, react-redux, react-router-dom, and redux-logger.

To view this project, it was bootstrapped with Create React App using the Redux and Redux Toolkit template. To run the app in development mode, clone this repo run npm install and  use "npm start" to view it in your browser Tests can be run using "npm test," and the app can be built for production using "npm run build."

For further information on Create React App and React, consult their documentation. Thank you for visiting my portfolio site, and please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or inquiries regarding my development services.
